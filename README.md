# Templates
This repo holds templates for using in other projects, and is an early stage work in progress.

## Projects
Every project follows the workflow:

- Get a task with a proper scope in writing (what do you need to do, what is outside the scope).
- Do the background research, primary sources only
- Do the work, automate and reuse code and knowledge where appropriate
- Test the work, automate and reuse code and knowledge where appropriate
- Document the work / Knowledge transfer to your line manager
