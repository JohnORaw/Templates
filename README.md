# Templates
This repo holds templates for using in other projects and services, and is an early stage work in progress. 
We separate out things that are projects (work that has a beginning and end based on milestones) and services (which have a start and end, but roll out for a specific lifetime). 

## Project Description
Start each new project as a new repo, private, shared with your line manager.
This is NOT the case if the repo will contain IP or GDPR related material.

Every project follows the following oversimplified workflow:

- Get a task with a proper scope in writing (what do you need to do, what is outside the scope).
- Do the background research, primary sources only
- Do the planning
- Do the work, automate and reuse code and knowledge where appropriate
- Test the work, automate and reuse code and knowledge where appropriate
- Document the work / Knowledge transfer to your line manager
- Sign off, project done!
